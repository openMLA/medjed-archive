The **Medjed** maskless lithography aligner is part of the openMLA series of photolithography equipment. 

>  **🏗️ Construction in progress**
> A lot is still being worked on for this system. Hardware is being tested and performance will need to be evaluated before people will be able to build their own system. 

### Current component selection

Below are some of the current components selected for the machine. They may change at any point and are not necessarily the best for the job.  Still, you may find some of them interesting components for your own project.

🔗 More detailed discussion of components choices will be put in the wiki 📑.

* XYZ axis: Snapmaker linear rails (not accurate enough for direct positioning)
* UV patterning: modified DMD projection unit from the Anycubic Photon Ultra DLP printer. See [this blog post for pictures and background](https://nemoandrea.github.io/blog/Anycubic_DLP_teardown/).
* Main optic: [Edmund optics 10X DIN Plan 0.25NA](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/10x-din-plan-commercial-grade-objective/5386/)
* Encoders: [RLS RLC2IC magnetic encoder](https://www.rls.si/eng/rlc2ic-miniature-linear-and-rotary-pcb-level-incremental-magnetic-encoder) - 244nm spec, 2MHz
* Stage vacuum: Tetra APS pump (diaphragm type, reversed)
* Microcontroller: [Teensy 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html)
* SBC:  [Odroid N2+](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-n2-with-4gbyte-ram-2/)
